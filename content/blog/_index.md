** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**

#for each blogpost create a folder and useful tip is to add a date
#all the posts need to be in markdown format and you can modify this using .RProfile
