description: Welcome to my personal website where I share the journey so far up until my current role as a cognitive behavioural researcher doing my PhD. My research interests include understanding the learning mechanisms, how we retrive information from previous events, language and music processing. In my research journey I have also been passionate about Open Science and Science Communication and consciously make my research and resources as open as possible for everyone.Here you will find more research projects I have been involved in and the contributions in the form of talks, posters and publications.
