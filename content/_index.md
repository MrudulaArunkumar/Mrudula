description: Welcome to my personal website where I share the journey so far up until my current role as a PhD researcher. My research interests include understanding the learning mechanisms, episodic retrieval, language and music processing. In my research journey I have also been passionate about Open Science and Science Communication and try to be conscious to make my research and research resources as open as possible. This website was also created in such a manner using `R Blogdown` and *github* to be more open and communicate science to the larger public. Check out the research projects I have been involved in and the contributions in the form of talks, posters and publications.
