<!-- this is a subheadline -->
Pursuing cognitive behavioural research through my PhD in *Friedrich-Schiller University Jena* in Germany. Current research themes include  exploring the role of automatic behavioural responses and conscious awareness during learning (inspired from higher order [Pavlovian Conditioning](https://www.simplypsychology.org/pavlov.html)). I have worked with reaction time, accuracy and eye tracking data to analyze and interpret how people learn under various learning scenario involving multiple cues.
