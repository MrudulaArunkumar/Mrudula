  What interested me the most about Psychology was how the aspects of our day-to-day behaviour can be explained and that it is possible to dig deeper into what goes behind such behaviours. During my undergraduation, cognitive psychology specifically drew my interest as it felt closest to what inspired me to choose to study psychology. While pursuing a Masters degree, I learnt more about language processing and explored how we communicate among one another. This in turn was useful to envision the scope and relatability of cognitive psychology and was inspired to do more research. Post Masters I spent a year working at the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics](https://www.mpi.nl/) in the [Cultural Brain](https://culturalbrain.org/) Lab performing experiments to investigate how (il)literacy influences the way our brain sees the world.
  
  Currently I am working on my PhD in Jena in Germany which is based on the project funded by the [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/) on Binding and Retrieval in Action Control ([BRAC](https://www.brac-psy.de/)). We aim to explore how the stimuli and responses we face in our everyday environment integrate to perform actions. My project specifically connects these short term pairings to long term learning phenomena. Check the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_and_Retrieval_in_Action_Control) for more information on this project.
