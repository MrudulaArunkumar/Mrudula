  What interested me the most about cognitive psychology is how the day-to-day behavioural actions can be explained and research beyond to understand the scope of our actions. While pursuing a Masters degree, I learnt more about language processing and explored how we communicate among one another. This in turn was useful to envision the scope and relatable nature of cognitive psychology which inspired me to do more research. Post Masters I spent a year working at the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics](https://www.mpi.nl/) in the [Cultural Brain](https://culturalbrain.org/) Lab performing experiments to investigate how (il)literacy influences the way our brain sees the world.
  
  Currently I am working on my PhD in Jena in Germany funded by the [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/) for a project on **Binding and Retrieval in Action Control ([BRAC](https://www.brac-psy.de/)). We aim to explore how the stimuli and responses we face in our everyday environment integrate to perform actions. My project specifically connects these automatic responses driven by short term stimulus response associations to long term learning phenomena. Check the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_and_Retrieval_in_Action_Control) for more information on this project.
